Hey. How did you get here? Doesn't matter. I'm writing a hack for Google Maps that will let people put up geotagged notes and save them. 
	Short term plans:
	 	SQL integration
		Photo uploading
		Lists and Categories
	Long Term Plans:
		Facebook/Twitter integration
		Following Friends Notes
		Curated Lists and Public Notes
Feel free to fork. That's why it's public. 

The code is designed to be lightweight (for the moment) and have minimal interface. 

VERSION .0001
First upload. 
	Right now it lets you...
		>Make a note by double-clicking on the map. 
		>Toggle free-move mode by double clicking a marker.
		>open an info window by single-clicking a marker.
